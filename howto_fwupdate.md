# Updating the Firmware

Updating the firmware is as easy as installing the DF1 iOS app.
Currently, only iOS devices are supported. Android is not supported yet.

In order to update the firmware, load the App.
We are in the process of posting the DF1 App on the Apple Appstore.
In the meantime, you can download the open source code and load it into your own device.

Once the app is loaded, simply:

1. Scan for the device
2. Select the device and go into the "Details View"
3. Press the "Config" button on the top right
4. In the "Config View", press the button that says "OAD trigger"
5. This will lead you to the OAD view, where it will reinitiate connection with your DF1
6. Once the "select firmware" button becomes visible, press it
7. Choose "Internal Image"
8. We recommend using "DF1_varfreq.bin" firmware.
9. That's it! The firmware update will take about 2 minutes.
